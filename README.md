#Countdown Project

This is an Open Source project to develop a count-down circuit that contains 3 digits for days, and 6 for hour, minutes and seconds.

## Hardware Project

For the hardware development I am using Circuit Maker from Altium, which is a great free software to develop open projects.
I split the project into two PCBs, one for the 7 segment display and another for the microcontroller and other components.
